  I am a Postdoc researcher in BK21 FOUR R&E Center for Artificial Intelligence at Korea University. I have obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Korea University, advised by Prof. SangKeun Lee. I received B.S. in Computer Science from Korea University.

  My primary research lies in the area of natural language processing and efficient AI:
  - Language Modeling: I study new methods to improve the various aspects of language models including effectiveness, efficiency, diversity, etc. I address any pipeline of language model development, ranging from pre-training to inference.
  - Commonsense Reasoning: I study new methods to improve the commonsense reasoning capabilities of pre-trained models including language models and multi-modal transformers. I am interested in augmenting the models with (implicit) commonsense knowledge by incorporating knowledge graphs and retrieving texts.
  - Model Compression: I study compression and acceleration methods of pre-trained models for efficient inference, such as network pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
